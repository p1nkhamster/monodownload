# Monochrome Playlist Downloader

Standalone CLI project for downloading tracks from:

- Spotify-style CSV exports
- Generated Monochrome collection JSON files
- Monochrome playlist links
- Monochrome public playlist links
- Monochrome album links
- Monochrome track links
- Monochrome artist links

It keeps the working resolver behavior from the fork:

- tries configured instances conservatively, one at a time
- rejects obvious preview-only results before accepting them
- prefers full-track `/track` responses when available
- falls back to DASH manifest handling when needed
- writes metadata, lyrics, collection artifacts, and optional ZIP output

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` available on `PATH`

## Usage

From this folder:

```powershell
npm run download -- --input "C:\Users\v\Downloads\liked.csv" --output "C:\Users\v\Music"
```

Or directly:

```powershell
node .\index.mjs --input "C:\Users\v\Downloads\liked.csv" --output "C:\Users\v\Music"
```

## Options

```text
--input <value>          CSV/JSON path or Monochrome album/track/artist/playlist link
--output <dir>           Output directory root. Default: ./downloads
--api-url <url>          Override the primary API base URL
--pocketbase-url <url>   Override PocketBase URL for public playlists
--quality <token>        Default: HI_RES_LOSSLESS
--no-lyrics              Skip .lrc lyric downloads
--no-zip                 Skip ZIP archive creation
--artist-folders         Use {artist}/{album}/tracks layout instead of the default
                         {source}/{album-artist}/tracks layout. Only applies to
                         album, track, and artist sources. Ignored for playlists
                         and CSV exports.
--plain                  Force line-by-line logs instead of the TTY dashboard
--verbose                Show raw request/resolver logs instead of the TTY dashboard
--i-know-it-doesnt-work-but-ill-use-it-anyway
                         Skip the startup playback preflight
--help                   Show help
```

## Notes

- Cache is written to `.cache/monochrome-playlist-downloader-cache.json`
- Output artifacts are written into the playlist folder, including `_run-state.json`
- A live TTY dashboard is used by default for interactive terminals; use `--plain` or `--verbose` to fall back to line-by-line logs
- Passing a generated `.json` collection file expands each playlist track to its full album and downloads only the album tracks that were not already in the playlist, so the result can be merged back in later
